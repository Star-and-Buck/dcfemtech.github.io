      <h2><span class="main-headline">Nomination Process</span></h2>
      <p>DCFemTech opened the call for nominations for outstanding women programmers/engineers and designers based in the DC region on February 24, 2016 and received 190 submissions. The awards were expanded to include a design category for 2016 as a result of the overwhelming response in 2015.</p>

      <p>Nominations were down selected by a committee made up of twelve women programmers, engineers, designers and executives for each category.</p>

      <p>This year’s programmer recipients were chosen based on: Impact on organization (helped company/non-profit grow & achieve goals); Complexity of issues addressed with code (building a webpage vs. a complex system); Impact on community (contributed to broader tech/women in tech community or open source contributions).</p>

      <p>The design recipients were selected based on similar criteria: Impact on organization (helped company/non-profit grow & achieve goals); Complexity of issues addressed with design (designing a platform that provides a great user experience vs. one page website); and Impact on community (contributed to broader tech/women in tech community or open source contributions).</p>
